## User Story

As a development team, I want to achieve 95% test coverage across our codebase, So that we can
ensure high reliability and maintainability of our applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Web app achieves minimum 95% test coverage
- [ ] Strapi backend achieves minimum 95% test coverage
- [ ] All critical business logic paths are covered
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios are tested
- [ ] No significant code paths are left untested

## Technical Tasks

- [ ] Analyze current coverage gaps in web app
- [ ] Analyze current coverage gaps in Strapi backend
- [ ] Write missing component tests for web app
- [ ] Write missing API endpoint tests
- [ ] Write missing utility function tests
- [ ] Implement error scenario tests
- [ ] Document testing patterns and best practices

## Definition of Done

## Notes

- Focus on meaningful tests that verify behavior, not just line coverage
- Prioritize testing critical user paths and business logic
- Consider setting up test data factories for consistent test data
- Document any intentionally uncovered code with explanations
