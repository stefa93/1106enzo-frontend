     profile.

## 5. Functional Requirements

   states.
3. **Auth & Protected Routes:** Profile and other sensitive features require login. Logged-in data
   protected from unauthorized access.
4. **Responsive Layout:** Application must function on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
5. **Tailwind-based Theming:** Consistent brand styling throughout with minimal custom CSS
   overrides.
6. **Testing:** Unit tests for critical components, tRPC endpoints tested with mock data,
   integration tests for main user flows.

## 9. Risks and Dependencies

- **Backend Availability:** Proper functioning depends on the tRPC / Prisma backends. Delays or
  issues in the backend will impact frontend features.
- **Authentication Complexity:** NextAuth integration or custom providers could introduce
  complexities in user login flows.

  may suffer (address, date, etc. must be accurate).
