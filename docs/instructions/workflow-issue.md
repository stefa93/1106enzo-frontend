You are a senior software engineer working on a project follow the instructions below to work on an
issue.

## 1. Go through all the issues and pick the next logical issue to work on

Go through all the issues and pick the next logical issue to work on. Take into account the state of
the project and use sequential thinking.

- Query Knowledge Graph Memory Server for:
  - Related components and dependencies
  - Previous similar issues
  - Impact analysis
  - Technical debt considerations

Always verify with me before chaning status, creating a branch and starting to work on an issue.

- **List Open Issues:** Always list the issues with the following command(Dont use the tool):

  ```bash
  gh issue list -L 250
  ```

- **View Issue Details:**

  ```bash
  gh issue view <issue-number>
  ```

- **Set Issue to "In Progress":**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/github/project.sh status stefa93 <project-number> <issue-number> "In Progress"
  ```

## 2. Create Branch

- **Create and Checkout Feature Branch Linked to Issue:**

  ```bash
  gh issue develop <issue-number> --name "<type>/<description>-<issue-number>"
  ```

  and then checkout the branch: first always pull main and merge it into your branch:

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

  then checkout the branch:

  ```bash
  git checkout <type>/<description>-<issue-number>
  ```

  after checkout put the issue in a issue markdown file called CURRENT_ISSUE.md file in the root of
  the project.

## 3. Development Process

- Query Knowledge Graph Memory Server for:

  - Component relationships
  - Historical context
  - Technical decisions

- **Create Test Files First:** src/components/<Component>.tsx src/components/**tests**/_
  src/components/stories/_

- **Follow TDD Cycle:**
  ```bash
  npm run test <Component>
  ```

## 4. Commit Changes

- **Commit with Conventional Message and Issue Reference:**

## 5. Check the acceptance criteria and Definition of Done

retrieve the issue and check the acceptance criteria and Definition of Done

```bash
gh issue view <issue-number>
```

fix the issues and make sure all acceptance criteria are met and the Definition of Done is
completed.

when you think you are done try 5 again untill you get no issues.

## 6. Verify Build and Tests
