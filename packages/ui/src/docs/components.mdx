## Best Practices

1. **Component Placement**
   - Place each component in the most appropriate category
   - If a component could fit multiple categories, choose based on its primary function

2. **File Structure**
   - Each component should have its own directory
   - Include the component, stories, and tests together
   ```
   actions/
   ├── Button/
   │   ├── Button.tsx
   │   ├── Button.stories.tsx
   │   └── Button.test.tsx
   ```

3. **Importing Components**
   - Always import from the category level
   - Use named exports for consistency
