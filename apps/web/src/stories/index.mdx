# Enzo Design System

Welcome to the Enzo Design System documentation. This guide will help you understand our component library and design patterns.

## Component Organization

Our components are organized into the following categories:

### UI Components
Located in `src/components/ui/`, these are our basic building blocks:
- Button
- Toast
- IconGrid
- Input fields
- Form elements

### Feature Components
Located in `src/components/features/`, these are domain-specific components:
- Task management components
- User profile components
- Dashboard widgets

### Layout Components
Located in `src/components/layouts/`, these handle page structure:
- Page layouts
- Navigation components
- Header/Footer

### Icons
Located in `src/components/icons/`:
- Lucide React icons
- Custom SVG icons

## Getting Started

1. Browse components by category in the sidebar
2. Each component includes:
   - Interactive preview
   - Props documentation
   - Code examples
   - Usage guidelines

## Design Tokens

We use Tailwind CSS for styling with custom theme configuration:
- Colors
- Typography
- Spacing
- Breakpoints
- Dark mode variants

## Best Practices

1. Component Usage:
   - Import from appropriate directory
   - Use TypeScript props interface
   - Follow mobile-first approach

2. Stories:
   - Place in `stories/` next to component
   - Include common use cases
   - Document props and variants

3. Styling:
   - Use Tailwind classes
   - Support dark mode
   - Follow responsive design

## Component Categories

Our components are organized following the Atomic Design methodology:

### Atoms
Basic building blocks of matter, applied to web interfaces. These are simplest components that can't be broken down any further:
- [Button](/?path=/docs/atoms-button--docs)
- Icons
- Input fields
- Typography

### Molecules
Groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit:
- Forms
- Search bars
- Navigation items
- Cards

### Organisms
Complex UI patterns composed of groups of molecules:
- Navigation bars
- Forms
- Page sections

## Tech Stack

Our design system is built with:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- React Server Components (with "use client" when needed)

### Key Features

- üé® Modern UI components
- üåô Dark mode support
- üì± Responsive design
- ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility first
- üöÄ Performance optimized

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from '@/components/atoms/Button';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Button variant="primary" size="md">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow accessibility guidelines
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Document component usage and props
- Write meaningful tests
